        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a boy I bought a horse. When I was full of youth I travelled the world. As a young man I plied the seas. Now I'm setting up for some other kind of adventure.</p>
        <p>I live in Northern Minnesota with my wife and son. I dream of hiking the Appalachian Trail. My hobbies include reading books, playing games, and building LEGO.</p>
        <p>I have an Associate of Arts degree from Rainy River Community College, a Bachelor of Science Degree in Maritime Technology - Engineering Officer from Northwestern Michigan College, and a Web Development Certificate from the University of Minnesota. I worked for five years as an Engineering Officer in the U.S. Merchant Marines before going back to school for programming.</p>
        <p>As a burgeoning full-stack web developer, I'm excited. I'm excited that I just spent the last three months learning to write code. I'm excited about the projects I've made. I'm excited about the apps I'm going to build. I'm excited about the people I'm going to meet. I'm excited about the skills I will hone to excellency. I'm excited! From basic HTML/CSS/JS front-end sites to MERN applications, I've enjoyed a taste of web development, and I ready for more.</p>
