## Description

This is my portfolio page, written with React! I wanted to make an update portfolio page to showcase some of the projects I have made during school and to display a short bio as well as my resume. I also wanted to provide a way for users to contact me by way of a contact form. The website itself is a showcase of something I built using React, which I learned a lot about while working on this project.

## Things I want to Keep Working On

* Use mobile-first design.

* Choose a color palette that distinguishes your site from the default Bootstrap theme and unstyled HTML sites. Refer to resources like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) or another color scheme generator to help you create something that will stand out.

* Consider using animations and React component libraries. Note that this will not affect your grade, but it might impact how potential employers gauge your knowledge.

* Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
